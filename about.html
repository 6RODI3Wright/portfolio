                    <h2> Brodie Wright</h2>
                        <p> Hi, I'm Brodie Wright. I'm from Milwaukie, Oregon, but I go to school in Eugene. I've always been super into sports, especially football, track, and basketball. They've taught me a lot about teamwork, hard work, and pushing myself to do better. Whether I'm out on the field or working out, sports have shaped how I handle challenges in other areas of life, too. When I'm not playing sports, I work with both of my parents. My dad owns Wright Choice Flooring, so I've learned a lot about working with customers and paying attention to detail. My stepmom, Jenny, runs Reliable Service People, a moving company, and working with her has taught me a lot about being organized and managing time. It's been great getting real-world experience while helping out at their businesses. I've also got three brothers—Conner, Mavrick, and Mason—who keep things interesting. They push me to stay focused and remind me how important family is. Whether we're playing sports together or just hanging out, they're a big part of my motivation. Outside of school and work, I love spending time with my friends. Whether we're playing games or just chilling, I make sure to enjoy those moments. I think it's important to find a good balance between all the things I care about and keep learning and growing along the way. As I keep going in school and figure out what I want to do in the future, my goal is to mix my love for sports, working hard, and personal growth into whatever comes next. I'm excited about what the future holds and love meeting people who share similar interests. I always try to make the most of every chance I get and keep learning from my experiences.</p>
